  <p>
    I enjoy building data-driven solutions and models that solve all kinds of complex problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve had the privilege of working as a consulting data scientist for an insurance provider under NDA, and as a web
    development intern at PCET, Pune. My main focus these days is on studying, researching, and
    developing models using novel predictive machine learning and
    reinforcement learning approaches in a quantitative investment context, and on competitive programming.
