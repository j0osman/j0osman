I am a **software engineer with a strong data and algorithms background**, focused on building **reliable, production-oriented systems** that operate under real-world constraints.

My work spans backend services, data pipelines, forecasting systems, and automation — with an emphasis on **engineering rigor, correctness, and deployment realism** over research prototypes or vanity metrics.

## 🚀 Work & Impact

**Production Forecasting Systems (Consulting, Insurance | NDA)**  
- Built and owned end-to-end forecasting pipelines in Python for workforce planning, achieving <5% MAPE on operational time-series data.  
- Enabled ~20% improvement in call-handling efficiency through call cluster approximation.  
- Worked across data preprocessing, validation, and stakeholder delivery.

**Systems & Data Engineering Projects**  
- Refactored a legacy full-stack application into containerized microservices using Docker and Docker Compose.  
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to enable automated testing and zero-touch deployments.  
- Focused on code safety (TypeScript migration, parameterized queries) and environment consistency.

**Applied Modeling & Algorithms**  
- Designed multi-branch LSTM architectures for correlated multi-time-series forecasting, emphasizing robustness, interpretability, and execution realism.  
- Explored sequential decision-making under constraints (transaction costs, slippage) to understand limits of naive optimization.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

**Programming:** Python, C++, SQL  
**Systems:** Linux (Debian), Git, Docker, CI/CD, AWS (EC2)  
**Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, PySpark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn  

---

I enjoy working on **backend, platform, and data-heavy engineering problems** where software systems directly inform decisions — particularly in environments dealing with noisy data, operational constraints, and scale.
