I’m a **software engineer with strong algorithmic and ML foundations**, focused on building **production-grade backend and ML systems** that operate under real-world constraints.

My work spans **backend services, data pipelines, and forecasting systems**, with an emphasis on **correctness, reliability, and deployment realism** over research prototypes or vanity metrics.

## 🚀 What I Build

### Production Forecasting Systems (Consulting, Insurance | NDA)
- Owned end-to-end forecasting pipelines in Python for workforce planning on operational time-series data (<5% MAPE).
- Enabled ~20% improvement in call-handling efficiency through call clustering and workload approximation.
- Worked across data preprocessing, validation, and stakeholder-facing delivery.

### Backend & Platform Engineering
- Modernized a legacy full-stack system into containerized backend services using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to enable automated testing and zero-touch deployments.
- Prioritized safety and correctness via parameterized queries, authentication flows, and environment consistency.

### ML Systems & Applied Modeling
- Designed multi-branch LSTM architectures for correlated time-series forecasting with an emphasis on robustness and inductive bias.
- Explored sequential decision-making under execution constraints (transaction costs, slippage) to understand failure modes of naive optimization.

## 🛠 Tech I Use

**Programming:** Python, C++, SQL  
**Systems:** Linux (Debian), Git, Docker, CI/CD, Render, AWS (EC2)
**Data & ML:** NumPy, Pandas, PySpark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn  

---

I enjoy working on **backend, platform, and ML-driven systems** where software directly informs operational decisions — especially in noisy, constraint-heavy environments.
