I build robust, production-ready ML systems for high-stakes forecasting and sequential decision-making. I specialize in translating noisy, real-world data into high-accuracy predictive models with a focus on engineering rigor and deployment constraints.

### 🚀 Technical Proof of Work
* **Forecasting Pipeline (<5% MAPE):** Built an MLP-based time-series forecasting system for a major insurer (NDA). Improved operational efficiency by 20% through optimized workforce planning.
* **Sequential Decision Models:** Researching RL-based policy design with explicit handling of transaction costs and market slippage.
* **Multi-Branch LSTMs:** Architectural deep-dive into high-dimensional time-series forecasting (See pinned LSTM writeup for design decisions and bottlenecks).

### 🛠 Tools
* **Languages:** Python (Expert), C++, SQL, Linux.
* **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn.
* **Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2), Docker, Git.
